darcs-buildpackage (0.5.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Failure to find upstream is no longer fatal in darcs-buildpackage.
    It seems that lots of people are generating Debian-native packages
    with version numbers that indicate an upsteam.
  * Fixed import of .dsc files for Debian-native packages.
    This would cause a crash previously.
  * Quote tag names before sending them to darcs as regexps.
