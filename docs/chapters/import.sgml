    <para>
      You will need to import sources into your &tbp; archive on
      several different occasions:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>You have existing Debian packages that you would
          like to maintain with &tbp;.  In this case, you'll want to
          import one or more full Debian source packages with
          &tbp-importdsc;.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>You want to package some previously-unpackaged
          software for Debian.  In this case, you'll want to import an
          upstream tarball with &tbp-importorig;.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>You want to update your Debian package with a
          new version of upstream source.  This case also calls for
          &tbp-importorig;.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>You want to import Debian sources from someone
          else (for instance, if someone NMU's a package you maintain)
          into your tree.  &tbp-importdsc; can handle that.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    
    <para>
      There are two different programs that handle importing:
      &tbp-importdsc; and &tbp-importorig;.  Both are covered in this
      chapter.
    </para>
    <sect1 id="tbp.import.deb">
      <title>Importing Debian Source Packages</title>
      <indexterm><primary>tbp-importdsc</primary></>
      <para>
	Importing a package is very easy.  All you have to do is run
	&tbp-importdsc; with the name of a .dsc file to import:
      </para>
      <screen>
$ <command>tbp-importdsc ~/dpkg/rdiff-backup_0.12.3-1.dsc</command>
 * tar -zxSpf "/home/jgoerzen/dpkg/rdiff-backup_0.12.3.orig.tar.gz"
 *** Import upstream package rdiff-backup version 0.12.3 from
	directory
        /home/jgoerzen/tree/debian/,,tbp-importorigtargz/rdiff-backup-0.12.3
...
* commited jgoerzen@complete.org--debian/configs--head--1.0--patch-1
...
Committed jgoerzen@complete.org--debian/rdiff-backup--debian--1.0--patch-1
...
* commited jgoerzen@complete.org--debian/configs--head--1.0--patch-2
      </screen>
      <para>
	In this example, I had never imported rdiff-backup before.
	&tbp-importdsc; therefore initialized the repository for me.
	It then added and committed the upstream version (the first
	commit message), committed the Debian diffs (second commit), 
	and noted which version in the archive corresponds to 0.12.3
	and 0.12.3-1 (third commit message).
      </para>
      <para>
	I can run it again with a new version:
      </para>
      <screen>
$ <command>tbp-importdsc ~/dpkg/rdiff-backup_0.12.5-1.dsc</command>
 * tar -zxSpf "/home/jgoerzen/dpkg/rdiff-backup_0.12.5.orig.tar.gz"
 *** Import upstream package rdiff-backup version 0.12.5 from
	directory
        /home/jgoerzen/tree/debian/,,tbp-importorigtargz/rdiff-backup-0.12.5
...
* commited jgoerzen@complete.org--debian/rdiff-backup--head--1.0--patch-2
...
Committed jgoerzen@complete.org--debian/rdiff-backup--debian--1.0--patch-2
...
* commited jgoerzen@complete.org--debian/configs--head--1.0--patch-4
      </screen>
      <para>
	&tbp-importdsc; is smart enough to know not to import an
	upstream version twice.  For instance, if I would now load
	0.12.5-2, there would be only two commits: a patch-3 on the
	Debian tree and a patch-5 on the configs tree.
      </para>
      <para>
	&tbp-importdsc; has a few restrictions: you must always load
	packages in ascending order of package version.  Please see
	<xref linkend="tbp.man.tbp.importdsc"> for more details.
      </para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="tbp.import.orig">
      <title>Importing Upstream Sources</title>
      <indexterm><primary>tbp-importorig</primary></>
      <para>
	While &tbp-importdsc; can solve many problems, sometimes you
	need to import just upstream sources (the Debian orig.tar.gz
	file).  For this task, &tbp-importorig; exists.  You will
	often use it if you have already loaded all the Debian
	versions into your archive, upstream has released a new
	version, and you want to package that version.
      </para>
      <para>
	Using &tbp-importorig; is simple and straightforward; please
	refer to <xref linkend="tbp.man.tbp.importorig"> for more
	details.
      </para>
