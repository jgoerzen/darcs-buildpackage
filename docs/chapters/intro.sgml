      Welcome to &tbp;, a system that integrates the
      <ulink url="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</ulink> package build
      system with <ulink url="http://regexps.srparish.net/www/">GNU
	Arch</ulink>.  There are two different programs that implement
      the Arch specification: larch and tla.  The more modern and
      better supported is tla, so this system and manual focuses
      solely on it.

      <title>Purpose</title>
      <para>
	&tbp; is designed to do this for you:
      </para>
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>Ability to track changes to both upstream and Debian
	    sources through time</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem><para>Ability to retrieve any version of the sources
	    from the archive, and build Debian binary and source
	    packages from them.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem><para>Generated packages can be built and used by
	    people that have neither tla nor &tbp; installed.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem><para>Provide an alternative to systems like dbs and
	    dpatch to help manage patches that Debian applies to
	    packages.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem><para>Provide a way to ease collaboration between
	    multiple Debian developers on a single package.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem><para>Provide a way to use the merging (update and
	    replay) features of tla to help merge Debian changes into
	    new versions of upstream packages.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem><para>Make it easy to try &tbp; and switch back to
	    normal systems if you don't like it.

	<listitem><para>tbp-initarchive can completely configure tla
	    and your working copy for you.</para>

	    source package into your Arch archive, handling both
	    upstream and Debian trees automatically.

	<listitem><para>tla-importorig can import an upstream tar.gz or a

	    show up there.

      <title>Usage Overview</title>
      <para>
	Here is a high-level overview of the Debian development
	process using &tbp;.
      </para>
      <para>
	When you first start using &tbp;, you'll run tbp-initarchive
	to set things up.  Then, if you have some existing Debian
	packages, you'll import as much history as you like by using
	tbp-importdsc.  Otherwise, to start a new package in &tbp;,
	you'll use tbp-importorig to bring in the upstream sources and
	tag that to the Debian area.
      </para>
      <para>
	As you work on your Debian sources, you'll use
	tla-buildpackage in place of debuild or dpkg-buildpackage
	(tla-buildpackage passes all its arguments to debuild for
	you).  You can use standard tla commands, such as tla commit
	or tla logs, to commit changes and view history.  When you
	have a final version of a Debian package, you'll upload it and
	run tbp-markdeb to record the version for future reference.
