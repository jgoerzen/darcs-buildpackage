    <para>
      You will need to import sources into your &tbp; archive on
      several different occasions:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>You have existing Debian packages that you would
          like to maintain with &tbp;.  In this case, you'll want to
          import one or more full Debian source packages with
          &tbp-importdsc;.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>You want to package some previously-unpackaged
          software for Debian.  In this case, you'll want to import an
          upstream tarball with &tbp-importorig;.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>You want to update your Debian package with a
          new version of upstream source.  This case also calls for
          &tbp-importorig;.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem><para>You want to import Debian sources from someone
          else (for instance, if someone NMU's a package you maintain)
          into your tree.  &tbp-importdsc; can handle that.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      There are two different programs that handle importing:
      &tbp-importdsc; and &tbp-importorig;.  Both are covered in this
      chapter.
