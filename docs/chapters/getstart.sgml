    <title>Getting Started</title>
    <para>
      Getting started with &dbp; is pretty simple.  This chapter shows
      you how.
    </para>

    <sect1 id="dbp.layout">
      <title>The &dbp; Repository Layout</title>
      <para>
        &dbp; assumes that you have two "canonical" repositories for
        every Debian package.  These repositories correspond to the
        upstream and the Debian versions of the package's source.  The
        upstream repository tracks unmodified upstream versions.  The
        Debian repository pulls in upstream patches, and also has the
        Debian-specific patches for your package.  (Debian-native
        packages have no upstream version and thus no upstream repository.)
      </para>
      <para>
        Normally, you would not work directly in the canonical
        repository storage area.  Rather, you would use <command>darcs
        get</command> or dbp-get to make a copy of the sources, and
        <command>darcs push</command> to push changes back to your
        storage area when done.
      </para>
      <para>
        The canonical repository need not be on your local machine.
        It could be any repository area that Darcs has access to.
      </para>
      <sect2>
        <title>Upstream Repository</title>
        <para>
          The upstream repository tracks changes to the upstream
          program.  You can use dbp-importorig or dbp-importdsc to
          import upstream sources from tarballs, or you can use Darcs
          to track a Darcs-based upstream with <command>darcs
          get</command> and <command>darcs pull</command>.
        </para>
        <para>
          Each upstream version should be tagged with
          a tag nammed
          <property>UPSTREAM_<replaceable>packagename</replaceable>_<replaceable>version</replaceable></property>.
          Note that the Debian revision doesn't appear in this tag.
          An example would be
          <property>UPSTREAM_mypackage_1.0.5</property>.
          If you use dbp-importorig or dbp-importdsc, this tag will be
          created for you automatically.  If you manage your upstream
          repository manually, you should create the tag yourself
          using <command>darcs tag</command>
        </para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Debian Repository</title>
        <para>
          The Debian repository tracks the Debian-specific package.
          The Debian package is represented as the upstream source
          plus a set of Debian patches.  Upstream patches are normally
          pulled into the Debian repository before beginning on the
          Debian package.
        </para>
        <para>
          Each Debian version carries a tag similar to the upstream
          version, but the Debian version tags begin with
          <property>DEBIAN_</property> and contain a full Debian revision.  
          An example is <property>DEBIAN_mypackage_1.0.5-3</property>.
        </para>
      </sect2>

    <sect1 id="dbp.configfile">
      <title>The Configuration File</title>
      <para>
        The first thing you must do is create your &dbp; configuration
        file.  It is called <filename>.darcs-buildpackage</filename>
        and stored in your home directory.  The main purpose of the
        configuration file is to specify the location and naming of
        your repositories.
      </para>
      <para>
        There are two items required in the configuration file:
        <property>upstreamrepo</property> and
        <property>debianrepo</property>.  The special token
        <filename>%(package)s</filename> represents the name of a
        specific package.  Thus, a sample file could look like this:
      </para>
      <screen>
upstreamrepo = /home/jgoerzen/debdarcs/%(package)s.upstream
debianrepo = /home/jgoerzen/debdarcs/%(package)s
      </screen>
      <para>
        More sophisticated configurations are possible.  (FIXME: write
        about them)
      </para>
    </sect1>
        
  </chapter>
