    <title>Getting Started</title>
    <para>
      Getting started with &tbp; is pretty simple -- you just need to
      run <link
	linkend="tbp.man.tbp.initarchive"><command>tbp-initarchive</command></link>.  This chapter shows you how.
    </para>

      <title>Archive Names</title>
      <indexterm><primary>Archive</><secondary>Names</></>
      <para>
	The tla system uses a globally unique archive name to refer to
	an instance of a particular archive.  (Arch supports mirrors
	of archives; each mirror has the same archive name but a
	different archive location.)  Generally, the archive name uses
	your name followed by two dashes and then an identifier.  Some
	people might just use "2003" for the identifier.  &tbp; is
	designed to have an archive all to itself, so I suggest using
	"debian" for the identifier.  So, your archive name might be:
      </para>
      <para>
	foo@example.com--debian
      </para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="tbp.getstart.init">
      <title>Running tbp-initarchive</title>
      <indexterm significance="preferred"><primary>tbp-initarchive</></>
      <para>
	Once you have decided on an archive name, you are ready to run
	<command>tbp-initarchive</command>.  It takes three arguments:
	your archive name, an archive location, and a working
	location.  The archive location is where all the tla files go
	(similar to the CVSROOT in cvs).  You will never need to
	access that directory manually.  You can use an sftp URL for
	the location if you wish to publish it on another machine.
      </para>
      <para>
	The working location is where you will do your daily work.
	tbp-initarchive creates both directories for you; they must
	not already exist.
	Here is an example:
      </para>
      <screen>
$ <command>tbp-initarchive jgoerzen@complete.org--debian \
  ~/arch/debian ~/tree/debian</command>

      <para>
	Every step of the way, you can see the tla commands that are
	being run, but you don't really need to know.  Your archive is
	set up; in the future, you'll do all your work out of your
	working tree (<filename>~/tree/debian</filename> in this
	example).
      </para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1 id="tbp.getstart.defaultarchive">
      <title>Setting Your Default Archive</title>
      <indexterm><primary>Archive</><secondary>Default</></>
      <para>
	&tla; has a notion of a default archive.  I highly recommend
	doing this.  If you do not, you'll need to use -A to specify
	the archive each time you refer to a specific revision in
	&tla;.  While that may not be often, it can save some
	hassles.  (The &tbp; tools automatically find the right
	archive and don't need to be told.)
      </para>
      <para>
	To set your archive, just use a command like this:
      </para>
      <para>
	<command>tla my-default-archive
	  jgoerzen@complete.org--debian</command>
      </para>
      <para>
	The remainder of this manual assumes that you have done this.
	If you didn't, some examples may not work, and you should see
	a doctor about that carpal tunnel :-)

      <para>
	The <filename>~/.tla-buildpackage</filename> file holds the
	path to your working tree.  <command>tbp-initarchive</command>
	will create and set it up for you if it does not already
	exist.  If it does already exist, and you want your default
	changed, you'll have to edit it manually.  It has just one
	line, which is the full path to the working tree.
      </para>
      <para>
	When you run any of the &tbp; tools except for
	<command>tbp-initarchive</command>, you can set the
	environment variable TBP_WC to a different path, which will
	override the default.
