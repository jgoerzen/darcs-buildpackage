        This command will have created the directory

        to contain the sources.  Generating upstream sources works the
        same, and puts them into a directory ending in .orig.
      </para>
      <para>
	If you don't know what version you want but just want the
	latest, you can simply use a command such as <command>tla

      <title>Building and Working With Source</title>
      <indexterm><primary>tla-buildpackage</></>
      <para>
        Before you start working on any source package with &tbp;,
        first check it out as described in <xref
          linkend="tbp.regular.fetching"> to make sure it is in its
        proper location.  Then, as you work, you will use
        <command>tla commit</command> to commit your changes to the
        Debian repository.  (If you just want to build an old package,
        there's no need to do this.)
      </para>
      <para>
        When you're ready to build a package, just run
        &tla-buildpackage; to build it.  The &tla-buildpackage;
        command takes the same arguments as
        <command>debuild</command>, and passes them on to
        <command>debuild</command>, so give it your usual set.
        &tla-buildpackage; will use your existing orig.tar.gz file for
        source generation, if it exists; otherwise, it will take care
        of automatically building it from the upstream sources if
        necessary.
      </para>
      <para>
        Here's an example:

      <para>
        In this case, I had not checked out the upstream source and
        did not have my orig.tar.gz file handy.  Therefore,
        &tla-buildpackage; checked out the upstream sources for me,
        generated the tar.gz file, and then called
        <command>debuild</command>
        to do the
        rest.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you are building for Debian, you will want to keep your
        orig.tar.gz around so that future source uploads use the same
        MD5 sum in the .dsc file.

    <sect1 id="tbp.regular.upstream-update">
      <title>Handling New Upstream Versions</title>
      <para>
        A common scenario for a Debian developer to deal with is that
        of a new upstream release.  The Debian patches from the most
        recent Debian release must be merged into the upstream one.
      </para>
      <para>
        There have been a few tools to do that:
        <command>uupdate</command> is one.  However, now that you are
        using Arch, you can use its built-in commands to make this
        easier: update and replay.
      </para>
      <para>
        The first thing that you will do is to import the new upstream
        sources into your &tbp; archive.  Please see <xref
          linkend="tbp.import.orig"> for instructions.
      </para>
      <para>
        Next, check out the latest Debian version if you don't already
        have it (see <xref linkend="tbp.regular.fetching">) and then
        cd into the Debian source directory.
      </para>
      <para>
        [ Note: I anticipate writing a program to automate the
        following steps. ]

      <sect2 id="tbp.upstream.merging">
        <title>Merging In Upstream</title>
        <para>
          Now, you are ready to merge in the new upstream.
          Run <emphasis>ONE</emphasis> of <command>tla replay</command>
          or
          <command>tla update</command>.
        </para>
        <para>
          The difference between the two is how they apply changes.
          <command>tla replay</command> will apply the upstream
          changes atop your Debian tree by first essentially applying
          patches made by diffing the upstream version onto your tree.
          <command>tla update</command>, on the other hand, will
          revert all your Debian changes, copy over the upstream
          version, and then re-apply your Debian changes.  This is
          usually the best option, but in tla 1.0, <command>tla
            replay</command> is easier.  The difference between the
          two only matters if there are conflicts; otherwise, the end
          result is identical.

            Just replace rdiff-backup with the name of your package.  This

              In newer versions of tla, you can just use <command>tla

          <para>
            First, you run <command>tla update</command>.  If you are

            add-pristine, using the version the first command gave
            you, and then run <command>tla update</command> again.
          </para>

          &tla11;
            <para>
              This is far easier in tla 1.1.  You can just run

              it will handle everything the above three commands did.

        </para>
        <para>
          You'll also want to note the new version in
          <filename>debian/changelog</filename> and rename your
          directory based on the new version.  I find it easy to run a
          command like
          <command>debchange -v 0.13.3-1</command>, then modify the
          changelog as appropriate.  debchange will handle the rename

          Finally, you will want to commit the merge.  If you want to
          just use a simple log message, a command like this will
          work:

        <screen>

        <para>
          The string supplied after the -L is the log message.
        </para>
        <para>
          If you want to add a more detailed log, try this:
        </para>

$ <command>tla commit</command>
        </screen>
        <para>
          The log-for-merge will add information about the merge to
          the textual message for you.  &tla; automatically records
          the information in its metadata; this just makes it nicer.
        </para>
        <para>
          You can see what happened by using cat-log:

        When you have uploaded a Debian package to the archive, you

        The reason for this is that you might make several commits

        you must update the changelog.
